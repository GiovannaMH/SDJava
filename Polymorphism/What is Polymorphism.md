Polymorphism in Java is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). Polymorphism is broadly classified into two types:

- Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
- Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
  
### 1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists (different type, number, or both). The compiler determines which method to call based on the method signature.
