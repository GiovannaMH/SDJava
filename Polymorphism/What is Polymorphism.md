Polymorphism in Java is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). Polymorphism is broadly classified into two types:

- Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
- Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
